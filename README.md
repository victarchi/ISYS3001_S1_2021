There are two general architectures for version management tools:1.Centralised systems – These systems store all of the codelines and baseline data in a centrallylocated database (called a repository).2.Distributed systems – Multiple versions of the system component repository are distributed overthe network, though there is usually one designated as the main repository.Both types of version management systems have common functions:1.Allocate version numbers for components in each codeline.2.Record all changes to each component. This allows identification and reconstruction of eachversion in the codeline.3.Manage the parallel changes to components. For example, this is when two different programmerschange a component at the same time.4.Multi-project support. This allows a particular version of the system to be used in another project,usually by a check-inand check-outprocess.5.Storage Management. Saving every version or every component can result in a very large storagerequirement. Most version management systems have techniques for reducing the required storage,for example by using compression, removing duplicate components,orby only storing theincremental changes to components.
